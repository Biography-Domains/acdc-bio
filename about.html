                <p>AC/DC, formed in Sydney, Australia, in 1973 by brothers Angus and Malcolm Young, is a globally renowned hard rock band celebrated for their electrifying performances, blues-infused rock 'n' roll sound, and iconic stage presence. Angus, known for his signature schoolboy uniform, and Malcolm, the band's rhythm guitarist and chief songwriter, established a raw and powerful musical foundation that defined AC/DC's unique style. Their early years saw them playing in pubs and clubs across Australia, honing their skills and developing a dedicated following. Their debut album, 'High Voltage,' was released in 1975, showcasing their energetic sound and attitude. The album's success led to international recognition, and AC/DC quickly became a force to be reckoned with in the hard rock scene. The band experienced a significant shift with the tragic death of lead singer Bon Scott in 1980. However, determined to continue, they recruited Brian Johnson, whose raw and powerful vocals revitalized the band. Their subsequent album, 'Back in Black,' dedicated to Scott, became one of the best-selling albums of all time, solidifying AC/DC's status as rock legends. Throughout their career, AC/DC has maintained a consistent musical approach, sticking to their roots in blues-based hard rock. Their songs are characterized by catchy guitar riffs, powerful drumming, and Johnson's distinctive vocals. Despite facing numerous challenges, including the death of Malcolm Young in 2017, AC/DC has persevered, releasing new albums and continuing to tour the world. Their unwavering commitment to their musical style and their energetic live shows have earned them a devoted fanbase spanning generations. AC/DC's impact on rock music is undeniable. They have inspired countless musicians and bands and continue to be a major influence in the hard rock genre. Their music is timeless, and their legacy as one of the greatest rock bands of all time is secure. AC/DC has sold over 200 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. Their unwavering energy and commitment to their craft are an inspiration to musicians and fans alike.</p>
